The Cocktail App is a React.js application that utilizes the AppContext and AppProvider components for state management. It fetches cocktail data from "https://www.thecocktaildb.com" API based on the search term entered by the user. The fetched data is then transformed and stored in the cocktails state. The loading state is used to track the status of the data fetching process. The AppProvider component wraps the entire application and provides the state and methods to its children components through the AppContext. Developers can use the useGlobalContext hook to access the shared context values within their components. Enjoy exploring and searching for cocktails with the Cocktail App!
